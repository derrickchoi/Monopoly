System Name: Hong Kong MonopolyGame modeled off Monopoly	
					
System Description:
This is a Hong Kong Monopoly game. There are only a few minor changes from the real Monopoly. When a player is moved to a new space by the random chance or community chest cards, they cannot buy property that turn even if they land on property that has not been bought yet. Rent is paid to the bank instead of the player that owns the property.

Global Data:
Don’t really have any global data.

Function/Class Descriptions:

CentralWidget.h
This class has all the vital functions/capabilities in my game. Including the buttons, pictures, bool, slot functions (drawcard, pay property, pay upgrade property, endplayerturn and run turn) and void functions such as create board, draw players, roll dice, player broke, updatespace and most importantly update space.

CentralWidget.cpp
My centralwidget.cpp is where i declare all the pictures and buttons. My drawcard and drawcard2 has the player draw a random card and implement it when they land on a card spot. pay property is called when the player presses the buy property button. payupgradeproperty is called when the player presses the upgrade property button. endplayerturn is when the player presses on the end turn button. roll dice is where the dice is rolled, players are moved according to the number and where my pass go and jail capabilities are. It also checks if players already own the property and if any rent should be paid to the bank depending on if the space has been upgraded or not. I have a run turn function which has the capabilities for the player’s turn and draw players which assigns a piece to the player depending on what number they choose from 1-4. move players sets the geometry of the pieces to its designated area in each space. finally create board is where the board and its spaces are created from GUISpace.

MainWindow.h
I have central widget here with a pointer of guiplayers array size 4 with a double pointer of players of type player. i have pn (player number), *pp (player piece) and slot start to start game.

MainWindow.cpp
I have QInputDialogs that get player numbers and their desired pieces by a number. player pieces is a dynamic array and central is set as new Centralwidget with passed in parameters. The guiplayers are set further down with two on the left and two on the right. I have a menu bar that has a start game function, player resign and quit the game functionality. The start function sets buttons and actions to be true because they were previously declared false.

GUISpace.h
GuiSpace.h has constructor parameters of x coordinate, y coordinate, space number and space dollar amount and a board of array size 40. i have set owner, check owner and owner functions with a bool upgrade.

GUISpace.cpp
GUIspace has a constructor with four parameters and six variables inside. I have getx, gety, get amount, set owner and check owner of space the player is on.

GUIPlayer.h
GUIPlayer.h has name labels to be displayed on side. and updateLabel void function with int space and int balance to update player space and balance on the side.

GUIPlayer.cpp
This has name labels for the bank and the player space and money. The updateLabel functionality takes in the QString of moneyLabel and nameLabel to display on the side of the board and updates each turn.

Player.h
This has updateSpace, getSpacea and setSpace functionality along with player’s pay money, print money and get money and protected variable double money.

Player.cpp
Player is given 4000 dollars to start with currentspace at 1. pay money is when player has to pay money, get money is when a player receives money and print money just prints what they have. update space adds change in space to current space to get the most updated space and getspace gets the space the player is on and set space sets the space of the player to that position.

Sorry.cpp
The main of the program. It opens the program and shows the main window and has a QMessageBox to signal the start of the program.

Space.h and Space.cpp 
Useless. Ignore.

Bank.h and Bank.cpp
They both have give money, take money and get amount but since bank has infinite resources as said in pa5, there was no need to implement the code. But there is a bank.

GUIPlayerHorizontal.h and GUIPlayerHorizntal.cpp
Sets player to horizontal in central widget. 

GUIPlayerVertical.h and GUIPlayerVertical.cpp
Sets player to vertical in central widget.

Application.qrc
This file has all my pictures in forms of jpg and png files.
